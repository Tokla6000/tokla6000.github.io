### Reflection on Digital Literacy as a 20-Year-Old Liberal Arts University Student

As a 20-year-old university student at a liberal arts institution, digital literacy is not just a skill set—it’s a framework through which I navigate my academic, creative, and social worlds. In a world where technology is part of every aspect of life, being digitally literate means more than merely knowing how to use a computer or post on social media. It's about the critical engagement of digital tools, the creation of meaningful content, and the analysis of data in ways that enrich my interdisciplinary studies. My digital literacy journey has been shaped by my exposure to diverse fields like Computer Science, Interactive Media, Creative Writing, and the Core Curriculum. Each discipline has contributed to my evolving understanding of how digital tools can transform the way I think, create, and collaborate.

### Content Creation and Social Interaction

In both my daily and academic life, I employ a variety of strategies for social interaction. Platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube are not just spaces for entertainment; they are also tools for storytelling and self-expression. These platforms allow me to experiment with visual narratives while building connections with others. Academically, I have employed the use of Microsoft Powerpoint and Google Slides in creating visually compelling projects, blending both narrative and aesthetics in producing presentations for class in a way that brings forth my arguments clearly. Sometimes, presenting data in a meaningful way in the forms of tables or graphs is a learning experience. I’ve used google sheets both for storing data and creating useful graphs. 

Collaboration has been another key component of my digital literacy journey. I have begun using GitHub to manage coding projects for my Computer Science courses. The platform has been invaluable for group work, particularly in projects that require iterative development over time. For example, I’ve worked on medium-sized projects for my computer science courses that require a lot of work and patience in developing them over a couple of weeks. GitHub allowed us to track changes systematically and resolve conflicts efficiently. Collaborating on code with other people can become tricky as it is unlike working on the same google docs, for example. Programs may depend on different files and making any changes on file while another person is making changes on another can lead to conflicts. What I’ve learnt to do is dividing up tasks in ways that avoids conflicts, allowing for seamless collaboration. 

### Research, Data Management, and Analysis

For data manipulation and analysis, I’ve learnt programming languages such as C and python along with some of their useful libraries. These resources have enabled me to manipulate data in meaningful ways. In one project for class, I used C to build a simple library management system that demonstrated how data can be stored and retrieved efficiently using hash functions. With Python, using libraries like BeautifulSoup, I've learned to parse HTML documents, extracting valuable information from websites. This skill has proven invaluable for gathering large datasets from online sources, opening up new avenues for research across various disciplines. Additionally, my work with Pandas has taught me the intricacies of data cleaning and analysis, allowing me to transform raw data into insightful information.The possibilities with these combinations of tools are endless, especially with how much data can be found online, scraping them will allow one to see certain connections and draw interesting conclusions. While my expertise in these areas is still developing, these tools have already shown me how they can be applied across disciplines—from analyzing trends in literature to visualizing historical data.

My recent experiences with data analysis have made me appreciate that data is never neutral or context-free. As Yanni Loukissas argues in All Data Are Local: Thinking Critically in a Data-Driven Society, every dataset carries the imprint of the specific place, time, and community from which it originates[^3]. Loukissas’s principle that “all data are local” reminds me to consider not just the technical aspects of data manipulation, but also the social and cultural contexts that shape the data I work with-whether I’m scraping websites for information or analyzing historical texts. This perspective encourages me to look beyond the surface of datasets, asking questions about their origins, purposes, and the assumptions embedded within them.

In a course on Digital Humanities, I was introduced to the concept of “distant reading,” which uses computational methods to analyze large volumes of text. Distant reading allows for the detection of “patterns of changes in vocabulary, nomenclature, terminology, moods, themes…” (113) and for the questioning of the larger social and cultural picture[^1]. By using tools like Voyant Tools and R libraries, I can do exactly that. For example, I recently analyzed a corpus of Rudyard Kipling’s works using Voyant Tools and R libraries. Drawing from my Core class, I understood the underlying context of colonialism and wanted to see if I could find any interesting trends within the texts. By examining Kipling’s word choices across his texts, such as “bad” and “good”, I was able to identify recurring themes tied to his imperialistic views and draw broader conclusions about colonial literature as a whole. This project deepened my understanding of computational methods which do not replace normal close reading but expand its scope, highlighting their potential for uncovering cultural and ideological patterns.

“Distant reading” is particularly powerful when applied to digitized historical newspapers. As highlighted in the essay “Why We Should Digitize Historical Newspapers,” such newspapers are invaluable for documenting the knowledge, communication, and cultural life of entire communities-especially minorities whose histories are often underrepresented in mainstream archives[^4]. Digitizing these newspapers not only preserves fragile materials but also enables new forms of linguistic, historical, and cultural analysis, making them accessible for research, education, and cultural projects

### Collaboration and Computational Thinking

One of the most rewarding aspects of studying at a liberal arts university is the opportunity for interdisciplinary collaboration. Working alongside peers from diverse fields has broadened my understanding of “computational thinking,” which Berry and Fagerjord describe as a combination of technical skills and reflective problem-solving which is rooted in Computer Science and can be applied to an interdisciplinary context[^2]. While computational thinking often draws on principles from Computer Science—such as automation, abstraction, and decomposition—it also aligns with techniques from digital humanities by encouraging new ways of formulating problems and finding solutions that bridge the gap between technical and humanistic inquiry. As a Computer Science major, I've been pleasantly surprised by the versatility of computational thinking within humanities contexts. 

This cognitive practice involves not just technical skills but also practical wisdom and reflection on how computation can be used to solve problems and create new knowledge. This has inspired me to explore new ways of thinking about data, not just as a tool for analysis but as a site of cultural and political significance.

### Critical Reflection and Future Directions

As I reflect on my current abilities, I realize that while I’ve made significant progress in digital literacy, there is still much to learn. I’m particularly interested in exploring how digital humanities can offer new perspectives on my studies in Literature and Creative Writing. For example, I’d like to experiment with generative AI tools like GPT-3 to create collaborative writing projects or explore how machine learning can be used to analyze poetic forms. How might these technologies transform the way we experience narratives or interact with historical artifacts?

In terms of computational thinking, I want to deepen my understanding of programming languages like Python and R, as well as explore new tools for data visualization and analysis. I’m also keen to learn more about the ethical dimensions of AI and how I can use these technologies responsibly in my creative and academic work. Ultimately, I see digital literacy as a lifelong journey—one that requires continuous learning, critical reflection, and a willingness to embrace new ways of thinking. By combining the strengths of my liberal arts education with the possibilities of digital tools, I hope to push the boundaries of what I can achieve as a student, creator, and thinker.
