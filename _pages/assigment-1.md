### Motivation
Voyant and R have an array of visualization tools to perform distant reading. I like to think of distant reading as text analysis where one questions the proximity and frequency of all the words in a corpus. According to Johanna Drucker, “principles like collocation of words are judged relative to other usage–and in contrast to the sum of all other words in a sample” where multiple factors affect the weight of the appearance of the words.[^1] Processes such as parameterization and tokenization which allow computers to “see” words and along with considerations such as of frequency, proximity, and collocation all contribute to a machine “reading”, usually an enormous, inhumane amount of words. Distant reading relies heavily on text processing and statistical analysis; it would be more accurately understood as a text analysis approach which is completely different and not necessarily the opposite of close reading as the naming suggests. Distant reading allows for the detection of “patterns of changes in vocabulary, nomenclature, terminology, moods, themes…” and for the questioning of the larger social and cultural picture. With this in mind I’ve decided on my corpus.[^1]

I am taking a course Encountering the Other that explores the question of “otherness” in a postcolonial context. One of the texts that I have read was written by Rudyard Kipling. He was born and raised in India when it was “the jewel in the Crown of the British Empire”, in 1865 and his life closely mirrors the rise and the eventual downfall of the empire, as he passed away in 1936, almost a decade before India gained independence in 1947. Kipling’s early days were spent in the vibrant and diverse city of Bombay while later on he moved to the British countryside of Sussex embodying his duality and contrasting nature of his work. On one hand, his short stories about India include detailed descriptions of the place and sometimes a genuine appreciation of the Eastern culture, landscape and people. On the other hand, a significant portion of his poems contain elements of racism, pro-imperial sentiment, and a firm belief in the superiority of Western rule. It would be interesting to see what distant reading could reveal about Kipling's complex relationship with India and the British Empire.

### Corpus Selection
This tension between admiration and imperialist bias makes Kipling’s work particularly compelling to analyze where distant reading could offer valuable insight into the patterns and ideological currents embedded in his texts. His works include children's literature, the famous Jungle Book, _Kim_, and many other short stories and poems. The fascinating thing about his writing is the ways in which he incorporates his imperialistic views into the nuances of his storytelling. For example, one of his short stories, "Lispeth", is about a girl born in Kotgarh, India adopted by a Christian missionary couple who raised her into a beautiful goddess and a Christian. One day, she stumbled upon an injured Englishman and immediately intended to marry him. Upon failing to do so, Lispeth rejected Christianity and ran away to live a miserable life with her ‘hill’ people. The line “it takes a great deal of Christianity to wipe out uncivilized Eastern instincts” encapsulates Kipling’s perception of the East. To explore how such ideologies manifest across his works, I have selected _Plain Tales from the Hills_, a collection of short stories including "Lispeth", as my first text. I have also chosen _Kim_, as it presents Kipling’s detailed depictions of India’s people, culture, and religious diversity. Lastly, _Rewards and Fairies_, a collection of historical short stories set in Sussex, where Kipling spent the latter part of his life, serves as a contrast, highlighting the duality in his representations of empire and home.
To begin my analysis, I uploaded the corpus into Voyant Tools. One useful tool is the “Trends” tool which displays, in a beautiful bar graph, the frequencies of words across all the texts in a corpus. In my case, this allows for the comparison of Kipling’s word choice in the texts. Since the texts contain a lot of descriptive words in the context of India and Britain, this tool should reveal Kipling’s view of these places. The “Trends” tool allows us to input words that we want to compare across the texts, so I’ve chosen common adjectives, such as “old”, “poor”, “little”, “good”, “bad”, and “white”. 

### Discussion
![Trends of the words old, poor, little, good, bad, and white in the corpus](./assets/images/trends.png "Trends graph")
The graph shows that the decrease in the word “white” correlates to the increase of the word “poor”. This is interesting because firstly, there is a higher frequency of the word “white” in _Kim_ (which is about India) than _Rewards and Fairies_ (which is about children in Britain) and secondly, the increasing trend of “poor” might closely match the increasing trend of another underlying word or context. Regarding the first point, this could explain the nature of colonial texts. While they are mostly about the Orient and its people, they are usually taken into the context of the colonizers. According to Edward Said in his most celebrated work _Orientalism_, orientalism is “a style of thought based upon an ontological and epistemological distinction made between ‘the Orient’ and (most of the time) ‘the Occident.’”[^2] He argues that it is critical to recognize that the existence of every culture calls for the existence of a contrasting “other”, and as such Europe creates the “Orient” in an attempt to define its own identity. It makes sense that there is a higher frequency of “white” and possibly other words to describe non-white in _Kim_ than the _Rewards and Fairies_. Secondly, the negative correlation between “white” and “poor” insinuates that the description of poverty is often not associated with white individuals. This could imply the notion of “white superiority”, a common theme in most Oriental literature. 

Another interesting trend is the word “bad”. Its frequency is almost the same for _Kim_ and _Rewards and Fairies_, but higher for _Plain Tales from the Hills_ shedding light on Kipling’s duality. This pattern suggests that "_Kim_" might contain more of Kipling's appreciation for India rather than only his imperialistic views, which are more prominent in "_Plain Tales from the Hills_" as seen in "Lispeth". The higher frequency of "bad" in the collection may reflect Kipling's critical examination of Indian culture, whereas "_Kim_" potentially offers a more balanced or appreciative view which is comparable to his views of Britain in _Rewards and Fairies_.

Next, I used R libraries to graph distinct words between _Rewards and Fairies_ and the other two texts: _Plain Tales from the Hills_ and _Kim_. The further away a word is from the center line the more distinct it is between the texts. According to the figure, examples of distinct words in _Rewards and Fairies_ compared to both _Kim_ and _Plain Tales from the Hills_ are “sir”, “king” “woods”, and “hand”. In comparison both _Kim_ and _Plain Tales from the Hills_ have “boy” and “colonel” as distinct words contrasting to “sir” and “king” which makes sense as these texts are set in a colonial setting. The contrast of “boy” and “sir” could show Kipling’s portrayal of India as inferior to Britain since “boy” represents youth which can be associated with having less wisdom. Moreover, in the comparison of _Rewards and Fairies_ and _Kim_, “evil” appears in _Kim_ which could imply Kipling’s negative view of India.

While some inferences can be drawn from these tools, it is worth noting that they are only working with single words and it cannot account for context, irony, or narrative framing. For example, the word “white” can be attributed to race, but it can also be used to describe objects. However, examining the frequency of the word, it is safe to assume–unless Kipling really loves the color white–that it is used in the context of race. To know for sure though, we would need to do close reading in order to discern the meanings of each word based on the context they appear in. A possible improvement would be using the wordVectors package which will allow the exploration of the relationships between words within the corpus by plotting terms using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as done by Suphan Kirmizialtin and David Joseph Wrisley in _Exploring Gulf Manumission Documents with Word Vectors_.[^3] This process should better reveal the intricate web of ideas and themes throughout the corpus, enhancing our comprehension of its nuanced content.

Through distant reading, clear patterns emerge in Kipling’s portrayal of India and Britain, reinforcing his colonial perspective. The higher frequency of "white" in _Kim_ compared to _Rewards and Fairies_ underscores how colonial texts, even when centered on the Orient, remain anchored in the language of the colonizer. Similarly, the contrast between "boy" and "sir" across the texts signals a constructed hierarchy, framing India as youthful and subordinate to Britain. 

This computational approach invites a broader question: if the biases of a single author become so evident through distant reading, what might such methods reveal when applied to entire literary traditions, such as colonial literature? Could large-scale text analysis expose the deeper ideological frameworks that have shaped how the ‘Other’ has been written about for centuries?
